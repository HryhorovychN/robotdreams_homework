1. Looking at the computed histogram, could it be considered bimodal?
Yes, it appears bimodal. 

2. Looking at the computed histogram, what binarization threshold would you choose? Why?
I would choose a threshold around 159 for optimal separation. 

3. Looking at the resulting (thresholded) image, is the text binarization (detection) good?
Yes, the text detection is clear.

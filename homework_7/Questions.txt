1. Why does the affine transform not work well in this case?
Affine transform cannot handle perspective distortions effectively.'

2. What can you tell me about the values you have obtained for the inliers vector? What does it mean?
Inliers are points used in the transformation; 1 means included, 0 means excluded.

3.How does the result from homography look? Does it work well enough?
The homography result looks much better and corrects the perspective distortion effectively.

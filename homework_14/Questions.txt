What is the overall accuracy of the classifier?
The overall accuracy of the classifier is 73.5%.

What modifications would you make to improve the classification accuracy?
Increase model complexity (more layers, more filters).
Add regularization (Dropout, Batch Normalization).
Use data augmentation.
Optimize hyperparameters.
Use pre-trained models (transfer learning).

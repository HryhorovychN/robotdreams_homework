Do you see anything strange in the final result?
Yes, some lines might be incorrectly identified as road lines because of noise or incorrect processing.
Do you think the Hough transform resolution is important for obtaining a good result? Why?
Yes, the Hough transform resolution is important for getting accurate line parameters, which affects proper line detection.
Do you think the Hough transform accumulator threshold is important for obtaining a good result? Why?
Yes, the Hough transform accumulator threshold is important because it sets the minimum votes needed to detect a line, helping balance between detecting meaningful lines and reducing noise.

Initially, when I used only the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat library, the detector struggled with detecting complex objects such as people wearing glasses. However, with the use of the mmod_human_face_detector.dat library, all objects were successfully detected, including people wearing glasses. This explanation highlights the improvement in detection performance when using the mmod_human_face_detector.dat library, particularly for more challenging cases like detecting faces with glasses.

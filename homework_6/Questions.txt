Questions

Does it matter whether the picture has been taken by a 1Mpx camera or a 12Mpx camera? How?

Yes, a higher resolution (12Mpx) provides more details and finer features, leading to more accurate corner detection but also potentially more noise.

If we increased the resolution of the camera, what would you change in the current algorithm?

Adjust the block size and gradient kernel size for the Harris detector.
Scale down the image before processing for efficiency.
Increase the threshold for corner detection to reduce noise.
